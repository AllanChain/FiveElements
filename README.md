# FiveElements
pygame made game related to five elements <br> 
developed under windows, python3, and pygame 1.9.3  <br>
to start it , just run FiveElements.py  <br>
it's just under development now  <br>
  
And I wrote`poly.py` as a polygon support for hexagon and octagon chesses.I am planning to make it a module for everyone to use.  <br>
    `poly(n,r=None,size=None,leftop=(0,0), center=None, lie=True)`<br>
    #to create a polygon with 8 edges<br>
    poly(8,size=40)<br>
