# FiveElements
pygame made game related to five elements or 五行
### Environment
- Developed under Windows, python3.6, and pygame 1.9.3
- I *think* it is OSIndependent
### Dependency
- Python3.6+
- Pygame
- And submodule poly
- Proper Chinese fonts
    - The characters are saved as images
    - Lack of Chinese fonts only affect the map name at start of the game.
### Usage
**NOTE**:Since I have not upload my package to PyPi, you have to clone this repo, cd `FiveElements` and run
```
pip install -e poly
```
Then to start the game , just run `python FiveElements.py`
### Development Notice
It's just under development now .
- ~~I'm adding strategy controlling system to it~~
- Better Animation is in progress
- Maybe AI will be written
- And the stablity too

### poly
And I wrote`poly` as a polygon support for hexagon and octagon chesses.Now it is a module for everyone to use.
