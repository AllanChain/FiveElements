# FiveElements
pygame made game related to five elements <br> 
developed under windows, python3, and pygame 1.9.3  <br>
to start it , just run FiveElements.py  <br>
it's just under development now .I'm adding strategy controlling system to it  <br>

### poly.py
And I wrote`poly.py` as a polygon support for hexagon and octagon chesses.I am planning to make it a module for everyone to use.  <br>
```python
    poly(n,r=None,size=None,topleft=(0,0), center=None, lie=True)
    #to create a polygon with 8 edges
    eight_obj=poly(8,size=40)
```
